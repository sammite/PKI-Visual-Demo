# PKI-Visual-Demo
A very WIP way of explaining PKI to newcomers

# This is meant to be used for a demonstration of PKI, by having a user
# input one code to "open" a safe, and a separate code to close.
# I don't have time or the place to do it right now, but my hope is to eventually
# rig a raspberry pi to actually work a lock in this manner, and use that to
# visually demonstrate how Public and private keys work.
# As you can see from looking at it, the code is... not good, to say the least.
# However, I wanted to make sure that I started working on the process and skeleton,
# and figured this would be a good place to start.
